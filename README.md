# Actor Watchlist Tracker

## Project Overview

Actor Watchlist Tracker is a full-stack web application that helps users keep track of the movies and TV shows they’ve watched, organized by actor or actress. By searching for a specific performer, the app retrieves data from the TMDb API and displays their complete filmography, including both movies and television appearances, in chronological order.

Each title can be marked as “watched,” allowing users to maintain a personalized viewing record and track their progress through an actor’s career. Whether you’re completing an actor’s entire body of work or simply logging what you’ve seen, Actor Watchlist Tracker provides a clean, intuitive experience designed for movie lovers.
